### Fried Tofo Over Rice

# INGREDIENTS

- [ ] 14 ounces extra firm tofu
- [ ] 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- [ ] 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil
- [ ] 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- [ ] Baby bell mushrooms
- [ ] Carrots
- [ ] Toasted sesame seeds
- [ ] Green onions

# Sauce

1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce
1/4 cup water
2 teaspoons honey
1 1/2 teaspoons red pepper flakes
2 cloves of garlic pressed or minced finely (see notes)
1/2 teaspoon rice wine vinegar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
A few cracks of fresh pepper

## Prep:

1. Prepare the tofu. Take the tofu out of the container and pour the water out. You will need to press the tofu for this recipe. Place a wire baking rack on top of a rimmed baking sheet. Place tofu on top and then put a heavy object on top and let drain for 30 minutes (I like to use my cast iron). If you don't have a wire rack you can use paper towels.

*Special Note:* 30 minutes is the minimum, I like to do an hour to hour an half.

2. While the water is being pressed out of our tofu:

- Finely dice carrots. I like to do two whole carrots, but I love carrots, so cut it back to one if you don't want the flavor as much.

- Cut the tops off the baby bell mushrooms. I like to use about a handful, then slice the tops thinly and set aside.

- Throw the rice in your rice cooker. I like Basmati, but that is my go to rice.

- In a bowl whisk together all the ingredents for the sauce. Start by stiring the corn stach into the water.

- Chop the green onions finely.

- Find your toasted sunflower seeds that you swore were in the pantry.

3. After the time is up on the tofu, dice it into cubes. After you have finished dicing the tofu, take some corn starch and cover all the sides of the cubes. This is gonna dry it out a little bit, but also give us a really crisp golden edge on our tofu.

## Cooking

1. In a pan, add the veggie & sesame seed oil and bring to medium high heat.

2. Add the tofu. Fry each side for 3-5 minutes, don't move it too much. You want to get a real crispy texture for each side of your cube.

3. When you are on your last side of your cube, add the mushrooms & carrots and fry till mushrooms are ready.

4. When the mushrooms are ready add the sauce, the sauce will thicken rather quickly. So, you will want to stir like your mom ask you to watch the stove for the first time and you are worried about getting whooped for letting the gravy burn. AKA until it thickens.

5. Once the sauce has thickened pour over your rice. Top with the toasted sunflower seeds, and the green onions (only the green parts.) Siracha if you want that snapchat shot.
