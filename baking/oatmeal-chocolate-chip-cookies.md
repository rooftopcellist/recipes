## Ingredients

* 1 cup / 227 grams (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened, more for pans
* 1 cup / 200 grams dark brown sugar, packed
* ⅓ cup / 66 grams granulated sugar
* 2 large eggs
* 1 tablespoon / 15 milliliters vanilla extract
* 1½ cups / 187 grams all-purpose flour
* ¾ teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* ¼ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
* ¼ teaspoon ground cardamom or ground ginger
* 3 cups / 270 grams rolled oats (not instant)
* 1½ cups / 225 grams raisins

## Directions

1. Step 1: Heat oven to 350 degrees. Butter two large cookie sheets, or line them with parchment paper or reusable silicone liners.
2. Step 2: Using an electric mixer, beat butter in a large bowl until creamy. Add brown and granulated sugars, then beat until fluffy, about 2 minutes. Beat in eggs, one at a time, until fully incorporated. Then, beat in vanilla extract.
3. Step 3: In a separate bowl, use a wooden spoon or spatula to mix together the flour, salt, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg and cardamom.
4. Step 4: Set mixer on low speed, and beat flour mixture into the butter mixture.
5. Step 5: Stir in oats and raisins.
6. Step 6: Spoon out dough by large tablespoonfuls onto prepared cookie sheets, leaving at least 2 inches between each cookie.
7. Step 7: Bake until cookie edges turn golden brown, about 9 to 13 minutes. Centers will still be quite soft, but they will firm up as the cookies cool. Cool completely on a wire rack. Store in an airtight container at room temperature.

_Enjoy!_
