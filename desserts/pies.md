# Pie Mischief

### The Crust

#### Ingredients
•	2 egg yolks (no egg white)
•	4 tbsp of ice water (make sure it’s ICE cold)
•	2 cups of flour
•	10 tbsp of butter
•	salt to taste (2 teaspoons)

#### Protocol (Steps to success)
1.	Put the flour and salt in a mixing bowl, knead in the cubes of butter together with your fingertips (keep it cool)
2.	In a separate bowl mix together the egg yolks and cold water, add to the mixture until the dough starts to stick together and is workable.  
3.	Form it into a disk.  Wrap it in glad wrap and put it in the fridge for 30 min.  
4.	Smush the disk out with a roller with 90 degree turns.  Then roll it out.
5.	Roll out more than you need.  Put it in the pie dish and crimp the edges with a knuckle and your fingers.  

> Note: Only crimp and bake if doing Pumpkin Pie or another type of open top pie, otherwise continue onward to the fillings!

6.	Crumple together a piece of parchment paper and put it on top of the crust.  Fill it with baking beans and bake at 400F for 15-20 minutes.
