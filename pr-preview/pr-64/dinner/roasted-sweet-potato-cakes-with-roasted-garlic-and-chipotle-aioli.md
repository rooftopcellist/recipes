## Ingredients

* For the cakes:
* 2 cups cooked mashed sweet potatoes
* 2 tsp cumin
* 1 clove garlic, peeled and minced
* 1/2 cup chickpea flour
* 1T fresh ginger, minced
* 1/4 cup chopped scallions

* For the aioli:
* 1 egg yolk
* 1 lemon, juiced
* 3 cloves roasted garlic
* 1 chipotle en adobe
* 1/4 tsp sugar
* 1/2 cup canola oil

## Directions

1. Make the aioli: Place yolk, lemon juice, sugar, garlic, chipotle, salt and pepper to taste in a food processor. Pulse to combine ingredients. Turn processor on and slowly drizzle in oil. Once all the oil has been incorporated and aioli forms, stop process or and scrap down sides. Turn on processor for another few seconds until the mixture is mostly smooth. Season to taste as needed.
2. Make cake mixture: Place the mashed sweet potatoes into a bowl. Add the chickpea flour, cumin, ginger, garlic, cilantro(?), salt and pepper and lemon juice. Mix well. Form the dough into small patties with your hands, pressing to make sure they are firmly held together.
3. Saute: Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the patties to the pan (you may need to cook them in batches if they don't all fit). Cook for about 2-3 minutes, or until golden brown, then flip and cook for another 2-3 minutes on other side. Remove from pan and cook the remaining patties. Service immediately with aioli.

_Enjoy!_
