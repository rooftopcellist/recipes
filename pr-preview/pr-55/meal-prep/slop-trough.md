## Ingredients

* 96% lean beef
* Ice berg lettuce
* Tomatoes
* Red onion
* Non sweet gerkins
* Russet potatoe
* Whole grain mustard
* Red wine vinegar
* Reduced fat sharp cheddar cheese
* Vegetable oil

## Steps

1. Cook the beef in a pan over medium heat until browned and cooked through, about 8-10 minutes.
2. While the beef is cooking, prepare the toppings by chopping the lettuce, tomatoes, red onion, non sweet gerkins, and russet potatoe into small pieces.
3. In a separate bowl, mix together the whole grain mustard, red wine vinegar, and reduced fat sharp cheddar cheese.
4. Once the beef is cooked, let it cool for a few minutes before slicing it thinly.
5. To assemble the bowls, place a bed of lettuce on a plate or in a bowl, top with sliced beef, then add the chopped toppings and drizzle with the mustard sauce. Enjoy!
