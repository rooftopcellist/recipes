# Mushroom and Gruyere Tartlets

These tartlets are crack. Don't bring them to a party if you are bad at sharing food. Or alternatively, make a secret second batch just for yourself.

**Author:** Megasauruss

**Serves:** 6

**Best Paired With:** We use a silicone muffin tin to make it easy to get the tartlets out.

## Ingredients

* 1 sheet frozen puff pastry
* 1 Tbsp olive oil, plus more for muffin pan
* 1 large shallot, diced finely
* 1 pound-ish of mushrooms, diced
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 2 tsp fresh thyme leaves
* 1 cup gruyere cheese

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees, lightly grease a muffin tin (we usually use a muffin tin with 1-2" muffin diameter)
2. Prepare the puff pastry: Lightly flour a work surface and roll out the puff pastry. Cut out 1.5" rounds, or whatever size muffin pan you're using. For our 1-2" diameter muffin pan we use a shot glass for cutting out pastry rounds but admittedly they're slightly too large. Place puff pastry rounds in a single layer on parchment-lined baking sheet and refrigerate while the mushrooms cook.
3. Prepare the mushrooms: In a large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add shallot and cook, stirring, until soft, about 3 minutes. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring, until soft and browned, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in thyme and remove skillet from heat.
4. Assemble: Divide mushroom mixture and cheese among cups, then top each with a chilled pastry round. Bake until pastry is golden brown and puffed, about 25 minutes. Rotate pan halfway through bake.
5. To serve: run a knife around the cups to loosen the tartlets. Place a rimmed baking sheet or large plate over the pan and invert to release the tartlets. Sprinkle with more thyme. Serve warm or else.

_Enjoy!_
