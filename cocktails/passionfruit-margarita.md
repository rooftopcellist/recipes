## Ingredients

* 2 oz Tequila (preferably a high-quality blanco for a cleaner taste)
* 1 oz Lime juice (freshly squeezed)
* 3/4 oz Passionfruit syrup
* 1/4 oz Triple sec or Cointreau (for a hint of citrus and complexity)
* Ice cubes
* Salt for rimming the glass (optional)
* Lime wedge and passionfruit pulp for garnish

## Instructions

1. Prepare the Glass: If you like a salted rim, run a lime wedge around the edge of your glass and dip it in salt. Set aside.
2. Mix the Drink: In a shaker, combine the tequila, lime juice, passionfruit syrup, and triple sec. Fill the shaker with ice.
3. Shake: Secure the lid on your shaker and shake vigorously for about 15-20 seconds. This not only chills the drink but also dilutes it slightly, balancing the strong flavors.
4. Strain and Serve: Strain the mixture into your prepared glass filled with fresh ice. If you prefer a smoother drink, double strain to remove any tiny ice shards.
5. Garnish: Add a lime wedge and a spoonful of passionfruit pulp on top for garnish.

### Expert Tips

* Adjust the sweetness by tweaking the amount of passionfruit syrup. Start with 0.5 oz and increase to taste.
* For an extra kick, you can add a splash of mezcal to introduce a smoky flavor.

Enjoy your passionfruit margarita! This recipe ensures a balance between the strength of the tequila and the tartness of the lime and passionfruit, without being too sweet.
