### Recipe structure

Recipes are written in Markdown, then Github Pages uses Jekyll to render this Markdown so that these static files can be hosted.  The are hosted at https://rooftopcellist.github.io/recipes

Typically, a recipe will have the following structure:
* Category: Which category this falls under (dinner, breakfast, "new category", etc.)
* Recipe Name
* Teaser Picture: Pictures to include at the top of the recipe
* Ingredients: list of ingredients, each on a new line. For example: "1 tsp Salt (sprinkled on top)"
* Cooking Instructions: list of actions to take to cook ze delicious food
* Tips/Pairings/Note to chef
* Final Picture (s): Pictures to include in the recipe page. Please limit this to one picture per recipe, and reduce the resolution to medium. The image format should be .jpeg or .png

Here is a [sample recipe](./samples/sample-recipe.md) to show you what I mean. 

After you create a pull request, it will be reviewed and merged by on of the maintainers.
