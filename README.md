# Recipes
A collection of my own recipes that have become standards at home.  I have also included some general tips for improving basic cooking skills that I have learned from Kenji's _The Food Lab_, Rombauer's _The Joy of Cooking_, and my housemate Tommy who is a fanatical cooking wizard.  

I hope you enjoy!
