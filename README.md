# Recipes

To visit the recipe website, go to https://rooftopcellist.github.io/recipes.

A collection of my own recipes that have become standards at home.  I have also included some general tips for improving basic cooking skills that I have learned from Kenji's _The Food Lab_, Rombauer's _The Joy of Cooking_, and my housemate Tommy who is a fanatical cooking wizard.  

To contribute new recipes, see the [Contributing Docs](./contributing.md).  Thank your for sharing your favorite recipes and for sharing your creations!

I hope you enjoy!
